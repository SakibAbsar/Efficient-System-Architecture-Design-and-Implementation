# Testing Procedures

## Sensor Testing
1. Verify sensor readings are within expected range for temperature (-40°C to 80°C).
2. Check that readings update every 2 seconds.

## Actuator Testing
1. Set a threshold for temperature, e.g., 30°C.
2. Verify the actuator activates when temperature exceeds the threshold and deactivates when it drops below.
