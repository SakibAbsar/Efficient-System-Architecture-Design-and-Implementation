# Project Documentation

## Overview
This project demonstrates a hardware monitoring system using sensors and actuators. It logs data, controls actuators, and provides a dashboard interface.

## Components
- DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity
- Relay or LED as actuator

## Operation
- Sensors capture temperature and humidity, which are read by the microcontroller.
- The system logs the data and controls the actuator if thresholds are exceeded.
