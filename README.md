# Efficient System Architecture Design and Implementation

## Overview
This project simulates a hardware monitoring system using embedded sensors to track environmental data, such as temperature and humidity. It also includes actuator control based on predefined conditions, data logging, and a dashboard interface.

## Structure
- **Schematics**: Circuit diagrams and PCB files.
- **Firmware**: Microcontroller code and drivers.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for data logging and monitoring.
- **Docs**: Project documentation, setup guide, and testing procedures.

## Setup
1. Connect sensors and actuators as per `schematics/circuit_diagram.png`.
2. Upload firmware from `firmware/` to the microcontroller.
3. Run `scripts/data_logger.py` to log data and `monitor_dashboard.py` for the interface.
